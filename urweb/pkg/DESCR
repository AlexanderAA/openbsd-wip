Ur is a programming language in the tradition of ML and Haskell, but
featuring a significantly richer type system. Ur is functional, pure,
statically typed, and strict. Ur supports a powerful kind of
metaprogramming based on row types.

Ur/Web is Ur plus a special standard library and associated rules for
parsing and optimization. Ur/Web supports construction of dynamic web
applications backed by SQL databases. The signature of the standard
library is such that well-typed Ur/Web programs "don't go wrong" in a
very broad sense.
